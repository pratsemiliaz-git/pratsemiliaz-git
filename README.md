# Hi, I’m Emilia! 👩‍💻

I’m an aspiring data analyst with a strong interest in transforming data into insights that support decision-making. I enjoy identifying patterns, cleaning data, and improving data quality to drive better results.

I’m currently finishing my training to become a professional data analyst. My technical skills include working with:
1) SQL  
2) Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
3) Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau)  
4) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
5) SciPy  
6) Excel (intermediate to advanced)

I currently work in quality control within pharmaceutical market research, where I ensure data accuracy and consistency. I’m now ready to transition into a role focused on data processing, analysis, and visualization in a new and challenging environment.
